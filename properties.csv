certain condition where a stressor (e.g. a chemical) is unlikely to
cause any adverse effect to a receptor (e.g. humans and other
organisms) (more related to intrinsic hazard properties of the
stressor) or where a receptor is protected from risk (more related to
control measures or mechanisms to minimise exposure to the
stressor). In any case, the term safe involves receptors, and with
that generally also requires the consideration of the contact
(i.e. exposure) between stressors and receptors as addressed in a risk
assessment context.",,,Caldeira et al. JRC Technical Report. Sage and Sustainable by Design chemicals and materials. EU Science Hub. doi:10.2760/487955. 2022,,,,,
