The PINK Annotation Schema has a modular structure and aims to cover the following features:

* Allow to categorise resources (datasets, models, software, etc) according to their SSbD dimensions and categories/sub-categories.
* Provenance, based on the [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) ontology. PROV-O is fully adapted by the PINK Annotation Schema, having the three top-level PROV-O classes, *Activity*, *Entity* and *Agent* in root.
* Extension of the basic PROV-O provenance to complex scientific workflows with spatial and temporal parts.
* Allow documentation of workflows that have not (yet) been executed. Such documentation is done at class-level. When executed individuals should be created for the evaluated activities and their input and output providing a full PROV-O provenance graph.
* Top-level taxonomy for (advanced) materials and chemicals based on [EMMO](https://emmc.eu/emmo/) with mappings to [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) for chemicals.
* Categorisation models.
* Strong taxonomy for relations, which are grouped into:
  - [parthood relations](https://pink-project.github.io/PINK-annotation-schema/docs/background.html#parthood-relations), based on mereology
  - [causal relations](https://pink-project.github.io/PINK-annotation-schema/docs/background.html#causal-relations), based on causality
  - [semiotic relations](https://pink-project.github.io/PINK-annotation-schema/docs/background.html#semiotic-relations), based on [Pierse semiotics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce-semiotics/)

Separate reference documentations exists for the following sub-modules:

* [ddoc](https://pink-project.github.io/PINK-annotation-schema/widoco-ddoc/index-en.html): The Tripper data documentation vocabulary, with terms reused from other ontologies and vocabularies. Mainly [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/), [FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/) and similar basic vocabularies.
* [reused-terms](https://pink-project.github.io/PINK-annotation-schema/widoco-reused-terms/index-en.html): Additional reused terms by the PINK Annotation Schema ([DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/), [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/), etc).
* [matter](https://pink-project.github.io/PINK-annotation-schema/widoco-matter/index-en.html): Taxonomy for (advanced) materials and chemicals
* [models](https://pink-project.github.io/PINK-annotation-schema/widoco-models/index-en.html): Taxonomy for models.

The root of the PINK Annotation Schema is shown below. More information can be found in the [background](https://pink-project.github.io/PINK-annotation-schema/docs/background.html) section.
