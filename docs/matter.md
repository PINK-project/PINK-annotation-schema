# The Matter module of the PINK Annotation Schema
Matter is a physical entity that possess mass and occupies volume.

This module provides a categorisation of different types of matter entities.
It is fully aligned with EMMO, even reusing the IRIs from the [HUMan readable EMMO (HUME)](https://github.com/emmo-repo#the-emmo).


## Taxonomy
At the top it categorise matter into molecular entities (discrete atoms or molecules) and different types of substances (homogenious properties).

Chemical entities are the union of molecular entities and chemical substances (specified composition).
They comprises the two different ways to represents matter: as single recognizable particle entity (molecular entity) and as a composition of particle entities (substance).

The following two figures shows the categorisation of molecular entities and substances, respectively.

![Substances.](https://pink-project.github.io/PINK-annotation-schema/docs/figs/substances.png)

Under substances we find materials

and the different aggregation states of matter
