# The Matter module of the PINK Annotation Schema
Matter is a physical entity that possess mass and occupies volume.
This module provides a categorisation of different types of matter entities.

At the top it categorise matter into molecular entities (discrete atoms or molecules) and different types of substances (homogenious properties).

The following two figures shows the categorisation of molecular entities and substances, respectively.

![Substances.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PINK-project/PINK-annotation-schema/refs/heads/matter-branch/docs/figs/substances.png")

Under substances we find materials

and the different aggregation states of matter
